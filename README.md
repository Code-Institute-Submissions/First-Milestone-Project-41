## UX

#### * As a developer, I want to create a simple yet aesthetically pleasing website that will drawn user in and give them an easy opportunity to sign up without having to visit other pages.
#### * As a user looking for a new gym, I want a gym that offers more than just that same old equipment, so I need to see what amenities this gym has.
#### * As an senior user I want to join a gym with a senior class, and I would like the sign upo form to be easy to find and fill out, as well as contact information and membership details.
#### * As a basic member wishing to upgrade to a pro membership
